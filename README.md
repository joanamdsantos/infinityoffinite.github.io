# The Infinity Of The Finite Blog

Going from number to number, from everybody to everyone, from atom to the universe are paradoxical insights to appreciate.

Data science is a growing field of study that focuses on getting insights from data. Starting from the questions that need answering, data scientists need to gather, clean and treat the relevant data, sometimes large amounts of unstructured data, from a finite but, perceptively infinite data process at first.

The Infinity of the Finite is a Blog about data science projects that move the edge of complexity for the improvement of the environment and society.
